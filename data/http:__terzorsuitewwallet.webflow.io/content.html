A PIN and passphrase can be entered into the device.</p><p><strong>Shamir Backup recovery:</strong> Most crypto wallets give you a single recovery seed, but Trezor’s added security method lets you generate and distribute up to 16 recovery shares for your device and store them in different places. Even if one seed phrase is compromised, the additional shares may provide another layer to protect your keys from being stolen. (Note that this option is available only on the more expensive Model T.)</p><p><strong>Fully open source:</strong> Trezor software can be reviewed and tested by third parties to keep its security transparent. Competitor Ledger has closed-source firmware on its physical devices.</p><h3>Where Trezor falls short</h3><p><strong>No native staking or NFT management:</strong> The Trezor suite, available as a desktop application or browser extension, allows coin management including purchases and swaps, but you’ll have to integrate additional software such as Exodus to participate in NFT marketplaces or stake coins with the Model T.</p><p><strong>Higher pricing:</strong> Trezor’s Model T costs $179, while Ledger’s similar offering costs $149 and can store up to 5,500 different coins. The Model One costs $59, which is close to the price of Ledger’s most comparable model.</p><p><strong>No Bluetooth connection or iOS app:</strong> Trezor has a desktop application, browser extension and an upcoming Android app, but unlike some competitors, it isn’t compatible with Apple’s mobile operating system. Trezor also does not offer Bluetooth connections.</p><h4>.
