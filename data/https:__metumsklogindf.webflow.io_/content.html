The extension for MetaMask can easily be installed on five different web browsers namely Chrome, Brave, Edge, Firefox, and Opera. After installing the extension on your device, you can set up a new wallet on the platform or if you have already set up the wallet beforehand, you may surely import your existing wallet by using the secret recovery phrase of the wallet.</p><p>However, the real problem arises when the MetaMask extension fails to open and you eventually end up being frustrated. So, what are you going to do in this scenario? Well, in the initial stages, you need to try to understand the problem-causing factor. At times, when your browser is not working properly or when you do not have the most updated version of MetaMask installed on your browser, you are sure to face issues with it.</p><p>In addition to this, an improper or problematic internet connection could also result in such problems. So, what you can do in this scenario is uninstall the current version of the MetaMask extension from your browser and install the latest one. Apart from that, look for any browser updates and then install the most recent version of your web browser as well. If that does not help, look for any glitches with the internet connection on your device and then rectify the error to use MetaMask smoothly.</p><h2>‍</h2></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=64e82a1b8c74f4adb979afee" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64e82a1b8c74f4adb979afee/js/webflow.24a563ff7.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>
