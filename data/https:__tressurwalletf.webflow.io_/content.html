Half of the traders think that the software wallets are the best and the other half think that the hardware wallets are the best. And between this debate, the fresher’s get confused and are unable to decide the best wallet for them. So, in our today’s content, we will give you an introduction to the famous wallet called Trezor Hardware Wallet.</p><p><strong>Are hardware wallets worth it?</strong></p><p>Yes, the hardware wallets are worth it if you are ready to spend some money for purchasing them. These wallets are worth the hype that has been created in the market. It is so because there is no software wallet available that could get in competition about the security of the funds. The first hardware wallet in the market was the Trezor hardware wallet and till now, it is the best wallet available. Hence, if you are looking for a hardware wallet, then this wallet would be the perfect choice for you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Get ready your Trezor Wallet for the use</strong></p><p>Unlike the sign-up process of the users of software wallets, it is a little different to get started using the hardware wallets. Given below are the setup steps of the Trezor hardware wallet:</p><ol role="list"><li>Take the USB Cable and then connect your Trezor Wallet and your computer.</li><li>Now you will have to open the link that has been given on the device of Trezor wallet.</li><li>Then, install the Trezor application.</li><li>After the installation, disconnect the devices.</li><li>And now again connect them back.</li><li>Now, set up a name for your hardware wallet.</li><li>Then you will have to create the PIN that will help you in getting logged in to the account.</li><li>In the final step, store the seed phrase shown on the screen.</li></ol><p>After the proper execution of these 8 steps, the Trezor wallet would be ready for you to use.</p><p><strong>What is the hardware wallet login process?</strong></p><p>Just like the setup steps were a little different than the software wallets, the process of getting logged in is also different. To get logged in, read the following steps:</p><ol role="list"><li>Open the Trezor wallet’s installed application.</li><li>Write up the login details.</li><li>A verification code would be delivered to you for verifying your identity.</li><li>On your Trezor hardware wallet device, draw the pattern for unlocking.</li></ol><p><strong>Summing it up</strong></p><p>Although it is recommended that you should go for the hardware wallets, a point is to be noted that the hardware wallets are to be purchased and they could be a little expensive. Whereas if we talk about the software wallets, they are free to use except for some basic transactional charges. So it is completely up to the choice of users whether they want to go for the more secure wallet like Trezor hardware wallet or for the wallet that is available free of cost but with not much security.</p><h2>‍</h2></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=64d474c010388009af39c605" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64d474c010388009af39c605/js/webflow.24a563ff7.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>
